# Webpage of a Past Project

[Link to Webpage](https://fatemaalhameli.github.io/ConnectionsLab/Assignments/Assignment%202/index.html)

For this weekâ€™s assignment, I decided to create a webpage for one of my previous Interactive Media class projects from Spring 2022 (Introduction to Interactive Media). This was a midterm project where I had to develop a game using p5.js. My webpage for this assignment consists of a description, image, and a video demo of the game. The webpage also includes two links; a link to the game and a link to the complete documentation of the game's development progress. 


Before starting the coding part of the webpage, I made three potential wireframes. I decided to go with the last one.

<img src= "https://github.com/FatemaAlhameli/ConnectionsLab/blob/main/Media/Assignments%20Media/wirefram1.jpeg" width = "420" height = "300"><img src= "https://github.com/FatemaAlhameli/ConnectionsLab/blob/main/Media/Assignments%20Media/wireframe2.jpeg" width = "420" height = "300"><img src= "https://github.com/FatemaAlhameli/ConnectionsLab/blob/main/Media/Assignments%20Media/wireframe3.jpeg" width = "420" height = "300">

## Coding process
In the coding process, I started off the same way as we did in class. Using the h1 tag, I created my web title and added an unordered list that included my name, class name, project type, and year. I then added another heading with a tag that contained the link to play the game. Benth that, I added an image of the game. After the image, I included a description of the game by using a p tag and added a link at the end that takes you to my full documentation. Underneath, I uploaded a video demonstrating what it looks like to play the game. Lastly, I added my footer, which included contact information. 
## Challenges 
The main challenge I faced was trying to move sections on my webpage, such as description location. After browsing through [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics), I used the table technique. This technique divides the webpage into two parts left and right. I kept the image on the left and moved the description to the right. Another challenge I encountered was creating classes. I was able to successfully create the class itself and add it to both HTML and CSS files however, it did not work. For instance, when I used a specific tag in CSS to change the font, it worked however, when I used a class, it did not. 

The location and adjustment of the video and description were not what I had in mind and in my wireframe. For my next steps, I hope to be capable of easily adjusting the locations of my webpage components.
