The application I chose to write my critique on was Sound of The Earth by Yuri Suzuki from experiments with Google. The application consists of a 3D globe made of triangles that represent the Earth. When a random area is pressed on the globe, a sound plays. The sound is meant to signify the culture of the country you pressed on. The goal of the project is to bring together people from different backgrounds through sound by challenging how individuals perceive foreign cultures through sound and unseen land borders or outlines. This interactive piece communicates the message that listening to each other builds a connection and helps us find an understanding between each other.


I believe the message behind this application is meaningful and important. The visual representation of the globe was interesting, and the addition of the zoom-in effect made it engaging. However, due to the spinning movement of the globe, I became confused, and I felt like I didn't know where I was pressing. I would definitely not have the globe spin and only keep the option where the user can move it around with their mouse. Suzuki’s inclusion of having the user in control of the movement of the globe definitely made it feel like Planet Earth. The appearance of country names on the left side is a great addition to the application. But on the other hand, I believe that keeping the country's borders unseen adds to the message of the application, but I would consider some type of an outline of the continents to make it less confusing for the viewer/user. Lastly, I think the chosen sounds were nice. However, I felt like the countries could have been represented with a more known sound. I would have personally chosen a short melody of each country’s national anthem as I believe they fully symbolize and represent the history and traditions of a nation and are likely to be known to foreigners.
