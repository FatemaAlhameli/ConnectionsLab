            <td><p class="description">This maze game was developed in p5.js. It aims to keep a player intrigued by having a maze to solve with limited time. At the top of the game canvas is a short list of instructions that specifies to the player the story of the game and how to play it. The player in the game is a boat, and he/she is supposed to get to the island because a storm is coming in. To do so the player needs to solve the maze and get to the endpoint which is the island while being aware of the time limit. The time limit is displayed as a decreasing red line. The player can move the boat by using the arrow keys and can refresh the game by pressing the key “R”. The game begins with a start screen that tells the player to double click to start after they do so, the game and timer both start. If they fail to get to the island on time, they lose the game, and if they succeed, they win. </p><a href="https://github.com/FatemaAlhameli/Intro-to-IM-/blob/main/Midterm%20Project/Final%20Documentation%202.md" target=“_blank”>Read more about this game development process </a></td>
